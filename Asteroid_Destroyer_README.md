# AERSP424_FinalProject
# Asteroid Destroyer

The C++ program provided within the GitHub implements a game that is based on a combination of Asteroids and Space Invader. 

The program is a user-interactive game that uses a GUI in order to present a Spacecraft that attempts to shoot down the Asteroids as they enter the screen. In order to win the game, the Spacecraft must shoot down all of the Asteroids that enter the screen before they are able to travel through the entire screen without being destroyed or hit the spaceship before being shot down. The game is over if the Asteroids aren't destroyed or if they hit the Spacecraft. Due to simplification, the game does not incorporate a level system or the ability to continue playing with additional lives once the game is over. 


The files that are included are the only ones neccessary to run the game. 
In order to play the game, the user needs to do the following actions:
1. Download the provided .zip files to a known location in their drive
2. Open the .sln within Microsoft Visual Studio
3. Run the program and play the game!

# ALTER THIS 
The user should press the spacebar when prompted to begin the game and control the Spacecraft in a left to right manner through the use of the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard of the computer being used. 

# If the user successfully maneuvers their Pac-Man to consume all of the dots in the maze without running into the Ghost, then the program will present them with a victory screen to let them know they have completed the game. If the user lets their Pac-Man die at any point during the game, the game stops, and the program will let the user know that they have lost. To play again, the user can simply press the ‘r’ key to restart or manually rerun the program from inside Visual Studio.

The user is able to modify any part of the game that they desire by going into the respective files and updating the neccessary code. The difficulty of the game can be altered by implementing a level system to the code or including an ability to have mulitple lives per game. In addition, the layout of the GUI screen can be changed and the number of characters (Spacecraft, Asteroids, etc.) can be updated based on the user's desired outcome when modifying the game.
